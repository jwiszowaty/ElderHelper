# ElderHelper-frontend
"Elder Helper" is a mobile application for two types of users: those who need assistance and those who are willing to offer a helping hand. 
The "Elders" or their caregivers can create an account on the platform and post jobs or tasks that require assistance. The "helpers" are kind-hearted volunteers in the community who can create accounts as well. They can browse through the posted jobs on a list or map and accept the ones according to their skills and availability.
