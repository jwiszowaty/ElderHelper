# ElderHelper-frontend
"Elder Helper" is a mobile application for two types of users: those who need assistance and those who are willing to offer a helping hand. 
The "Elders" or their caregivers can create an account on the platform and post jobs or tasks that require assistance. The "helpers" are kind-hearted volunteers in the community who can create accounts as well. They can browse through the posted jobs on a list or map and accept the ones according to their skills and availability. 

We built this app using React Native which we learnt in the project phase of the bootcamp.
Through this project we gained experience in
- implimenting Google Maps
- styling in React Native
- navigation within the app
